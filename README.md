# JSONSchema Generator - Bachelor Thesis @ UNIPI


This is a place-holder repo for my Bachelor Thesis.

The project consists in the construction of an algorithm for the verification of the satisfiability of a set of constraints expressed in the JSON Schema syntax.

Future works are the development of a module to generate witnesses, or the extension of the algorithm to verify the inclusion of a JSON Schema in another one.

The project was subsequently taken over by the research group of my supervisor - Prof. G. Ghelli- and is still in development. The real repository is at [this link](https://github.com/miniHive/JSONAlgebra), however at the moment it is still private.
